# Project Overview
This project examines the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy across six countries—Zimbabwe, China, Chile, United States, Germany, and Mexico—over the period from 2000 to 2015. The analysis aims to answer several key questions:

- How did GDP and life expectancy change over these years?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy?
- Is this relationship consistent across all countries? What does it look like when aggregated?
- How are the distributions of GDP and life expectancy across different countries?
# Key Findings
### General Trends:
Both GDP and life expectancy showed overall growth during the study period. GDP experienced a significant dip around 2008-2009, likely due to the global financial crisis, while life expectancy steadily increased.

### Correlation Analysis:
There is a notable correlation between GDP and life expectancy when data is aggregated. However, this relationship varies significantly across individual countries, suggesting that while GDP growth often coincides with improvements in life expectancy, the dynamics of this relationship are complex and context-dependent.

### Country-Specific Observations:

- Zimbabwe: Showed the highest variability in life expectancy, with significant improvements yet still lagging behind other countries by over 15 years.
- Mexico: Experienced the least increase in life expectancy.
- Germany: Maintained the highest life expectancy throughout the period.
- China: Recorded the largest relative increase in GDP.
- Chile: Despite economic growth, its GDP remains relatively small and less visible when graphed alongside the other countries.
### GDP and Life Expectancy Distributions:
The distributions of life expectancy were relatively consistent across most countries, except for Zimbabwe. GDP distributions, however, varied significantly, reflecting the economic disparities among the nations.

### Linear Regression Analysis:
Linear models indicated a significant portion of GDP variance was reflected in life expectancy variance. The United States data showed a strong linear relationship, while China's data suggested more complex, non-linear dynamics.

# Conclusion
The analysis highlights a general trend of correlated growth between GDP and life expectancy across the studied countries, albeit with significant variations in the strength and nature of this relationship. The findings underscore the importance of considering national contexts and other underlying factors when interpreting the correlation between economic and health indicators.

## Future Directions
Further research with more comprehensive data is necessary to better understand the nuances of the GDP-life expectancy relationship. It is crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation, and more sophisticated models might be needed to capture the complexities of this relationship.
